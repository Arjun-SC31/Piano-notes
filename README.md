# Piano-notes
An audio file containing a sequence of piano notes is given as input, the notes would be recognised and displayed.
The source code for the same is written in MATLAB.

The frequency and pitch of the note is identified, the input audio file is broken down into several notewindows which are independently 
analysed.

The fast fourier transform is plotted for each identified note. Based on the observed frequency, the note is assigned a pitch and octave.
